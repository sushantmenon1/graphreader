      "Richard Pratt is a famous gourmet who is the president of a small society known as the Epicures. He is well-known for circulating pamphlets on food and wines to the society members, organizing sumptuous dinners, and displaying in-depth knowledge about wines. Richard Pratt has a special way of describing wines as though they were living entities, attributing human characteristics to them. During a dinner at Mike Schofield's house, a betting game was played involving naming the breed and vintage of wine, where Pratt displayed his knowledge and earned a reputation for recognizing wines accurately. Later in the evening, a bet was proposed by Richard Pratt to Mike Schofield, requesting his daughter's hand in marriage as part of the wager. The daughter, Louise, expressed disapproval at first, but reluctantly agreed with assurance from her father that there was no risk involved. Ultimately, the situation escalated with Pratt confidently identifying a wine correctly and appearing as a winner in the event. Additionally, a maid at the dinner party returned a pair of spectacles to Pratt, adding an element of intrigue to the scene.\n"
